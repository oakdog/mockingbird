# mockingbird
Simple sample React/Redux app to search Twitter. Allows creation of categories/subcategories to be used in search, the terms of which can be either customized or saved from result data.

# Notes:
- The twitter api requires an acount, token, & key. This has been removed from the server/mockingbird.php script for security. If you would like to set these up & actually run the app from your own server, instructions can be found here: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/guides/access-tokens
- I've of course not included the node_modules, but I don't believe there should be any peculiarities to "npm install"-ing what you'll find in the client/package.json
